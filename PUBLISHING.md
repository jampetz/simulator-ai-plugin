# Publishing

This document describes how to publish a new version of the Simulator.Company AI plugin.

## 1. Validate Manifests Locally

Check that all JSON manifests are well-formed:

```bash
python3 -m json.tool .claude-plugin/marketplace.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool .agents/plugins/marketplace.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool plugins/simulator/.claude-plugin/plugin.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool plugins/simulator/.codex-plugin/plugin.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool plugins/simulator/.mcp.json >/dev/null
```

Verify version sync between manifests:

```bash
grep -E '"version"|^version:' \
  plugins/simulator/.claude-plugin/plugin.json \
  plugins/simulator/.codex-plugin/plugin.json \
  plugins/simulator/.kiro-plugin/plugin.json \
  .claude-plugin/marketplace.json \
  .agents/plugins/marketplace.json \
  POWER.md
```

All six should show the same version number.

## 2. Verify Build & Tests

```bash
make build
make vet
make test
make discovery   # regenerate public/ — commit any diff
```

## 3. Test in Claude Code

Install the plugin from the local clone:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ./
claude plugin install simulator@simulator
```

Verify that the Simulator skills load and the MCP server starts. Run a quick smoke test:

```
log in to Simulator
```

## 4. Test in Codex

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add ./
codex plugin add simulator@simulator
```

Confirm the install with `codex plugin list` (the **simulator** plugin should be listed). Then restart Codex, start a session, and run `/mcp` — the `simulator` MCP server and its tools should appear, and the skills become available in conversation.

## 4b. Test in AWS Kiro

```bash
plugins/simulator/scripts/install-kiro.sh "$YOUR_KIRO_WORKSPACE"
```

Open the workspace in Kiro. Confirm:

- `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` is loaded and the `simulator` MCP server appears in Kiro's tool panel.
- `.kiro/steering/simulator.md` shows in the steering UI.
- A prompt like "use simulator" routes through `.kiro/skills/simulator/SKILL.md`.
- A live tool call (e.g. `login`) succeeds end-to-end.

The script is idempotent and supports re-runs to refresh the workspace overlay.

## 5. Update Files

1. Bump the version in **six** files (every host manifest plus the Power manifest):
   - `plugins/simulator/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
   - `plugins/simulator/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
   - `plugins/simulator/.kiro-plugin/plugin.json`
   - `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (the `plugins[0].version` field)
   - `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` (the `plugins[0].version` field)
   - `POWER.md` (frontmatter `version:` field)
2. Add a section to `CHANGELOG.md` for the new version.
3. Commit the changes.

## 6. Push to GitHub and Tag

```bash
git push origin main
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The `release.yml` workflow fires automatically on any `v*` tag. It cross-compiles the MCP server for `darwin/linux × amd64/arm64`, generates SHA-256 checksums, attests build provenance, regenerates `public/` via `make discovery`, and creates a GitHub Release whose body is the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section. `POWER.md` is attached to every Release so kiro.dev/powers can resolve the Power manifest from the tag — Kiro users install via the clone path described below; there is no *pre-built* `.kiro/` zip artifact attached to the Release (a release-only overlay would still need a post-extract step to resolve the `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` token). `install-kiro.sh --power` / `--install-power` build that overlay locally instead, from whatever clone/tag the user has checked out — see below.

## 7. Install from GitHub

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add corezoid/simulator-ai-plugin
claude plugin install simulator@simulator
```

**Codex (stable):**

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add corezoid/simulator-ai-plugin --ref vX.Y.Z
codex plugin add simulator@simulator
```

**Codex (development tracking):**

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add corezoid/simulator-ai-plugin --ref main
codex plugin add simulator@simulator
```

**AWS Kiro:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/corezoid/simulator-ai-plugin
plugins/simulator/scripts/install-kiro.sh "$YOUR_KIRO_WORKSPACE"
```

The script hard-copies the skills into the workspace and resolves the
`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` token in each `SKILL.md` to the absolute plugin path.
Kiro does no token substitution on its own, so this install-time resolve
step is required. The script is idempotent; re-run it after a `git pull`
to refresh the workspace overlay.

By default this same invocation also builds a portable Power bundle and
installs it into `~/.kiro/powers/`, registering the plugin as a Kiro Power
globally rather than just in one workspace. Drive either half standalone with
`install-kiro.sh --power [output-dir]` (build only) or `install-kiro.sh
--install-power` (build + register locally, skipping the workspace step).
The bundle's `mcp.json` still resolves back to this clone's absolute
`mcp-server/` path — the MCP server payload itself doesn't travel inside the
bundle, so it isn't portable to a different machine's clone, only to a
different Kiro instance on this one.

To list this Power on **kiro.dev/powers**, submit the release tag URL to the
Kiro Power registry. `POWER.md` is attached to every GitHub Release so the
registry can resolve metadata from the tag.

## 8. Notify Users

After tagging, ask users to upgrade their local marketplace and plugin:

- **Claude Code:** `claude plugin marketplace update && claude plugin update simulator@simulator`
- **Codex:** `codex plugin marketplace upgrade && codex plugin add simulator@simulator`
