> **Status:** stable — released, actively maintained. Supported clients: Claude Code ≥ 1.x, Codex, AWS Kiro. Go 1.24+ required. macOS and Linux tested.

A plugin for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), [Codex](https://codex.openai.com) and [AWS Kiro](https://kiro.dev) that connects the [Simulator.Company](https://simulator.company) platform to Claude via MCP (Model Context Protocol). Claude gets direct access to the Simulator REST API and domain knowledge to manage actors, graphs, forms, and financial accounts through natural conversation.

## What it does

The plugin bundles a Go MCP server that exposes the full Simulator.Company public API as MCP tools and provides specialist skills that teach Claude the platform's entity model and common workflows:

| Skill                | Activate with                                            | Covers                                                  |

## Installation

### Claude Code

**From the GitHub marketplace:**

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add corezoid/simulator-ai-plugin
claude plugin install simulator@simulator
```

**Or from a local clone:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/corezoid/simulator-ai-plugin
claude plugin marketplace add ./simulator-ai-plugin
claude plugin install simulator@simulator
```

### Codex

**From the GitHub marketplace:**

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add corezoid/simulator-ai-plugin
codex plugin add simulator@simulator
```

**Or from a local clone:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/corezoid/simulator-ai-plugin
codex plugin marketplace add ./simulator-ai-plugin
codex plugin add simulator@simulator
```

No build step, no extra setup. The MCP server starts automatically on first use.

### AWS Kiro

Kiro has no marketplace command and does not resolve the `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` token that Claude Code and Codex substitute at skill-load time, so it installs from a local clone via a helper script that copies the plugin into the workspace's `.kiro/` and resolves that token to an absolute path:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/corezoid/simulator-ai-plugin
cd simulator-ai-plugin
sh plugins/simulator/scripts/install-kiro.sh .   # installs into the current dir (pass another workspace-dir instead of `.` to target elsewhere) AND registers the plugin as a Kiro Power globally
```

This does two things in one run:

1. **Workspace overlay.** Writes the MCP entry to `<workspace>/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` with the plugin path resolved to an absolute path (no reliance on `KIRO_PLUGIN_ROOT` or workspace layout), symlinks the steering file into `.kiro/steering/`, and hard-copies each skill into `.kiro/skills/<name>/` with `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` replaced the same way. Open the workspace in Kiro and the MCP server, skills, and steering are picked up automatically. `.mcp.kiro.json` also self-heals if Kiro loads it directly without the script ever having run — it probes for `mcp-server/run.sh` next to its workspace-root guess and falls back to `plugins/simulator/` when that guess misses.
2. **Global Power registration.** Builds a Kiro Power bundle and installs it into `~/.kiro/powers/` (restart Kiro afterwards to pick it up), so the plugin is available as a Power in *every* workspace, not just the one above. The plugin is also published to [kiro.dev/powers](https://kiro.dev/powers) — see [`POWER.md`](POWER.md).

To drive either half on its own instead of both together:

```bash
plugins/simulator/scripts/install-kiro.sh --power [output-dir]     # just build a portable bundle (default: power-simulator/), no install
plugins/simulator/scripts/install-kiro.sh --install-power          # just build + register it in this machine's local Kiro, skip the workspace step
```

The bundle's `POWER.md`, `mcp.json`, and one steering file per skill are regenerated from scratch every run — `mcp.json` still resolves back to this exact clone's absolute `mcp-server/` path (the actual server payload doesn't travel inside the bundle), so the Power stays tied to this clone, same as workspace-install mode.

### Updating

```bash
claude plugin update simulator@simulator                                    # Claude Code
codex plugin marketplace upgrade && codex plugin add simulator@simulator    # Codex
```

Codex has no `plugin update` subcommand — refresh the marketplace snapshot with
`codex plugin marketplace upgrade` (upgrades all configured Git marketplaces; pass a
name to target one) and re-run `codex plugin add` to install the refreshed version.
Restart Claude Code / Codex after updating to apply the new version. For AWS Kiro, `git pull` the clone and re-run `plugins/simulator/scripts/install-kiro.sh` (it is idempotent) to refresh the workspace overlay.

## Authentication

Simulator runs on many environments (cloud, on-prem, local dev), so the first step is to
**choose one**. The `set-environment` tool takes a cloud preset — `mw.simulator.company`
(default) or `sim.simulator.company` — or a custom/local URL (host or full URL; `/papi/1.0`
is appended if omitted). It fetches that gateway's **public config** to derive the correct
OAuth account URL — the platform authenticates through the `account` system, and one account
may back several environments, so the auth URL is determined per gateway rather than fixed.
The chosen API base and account URL are saved to `.env` (`SIMULATOR_API_BASE_URL`,
`ACCOUNT_URL`). Switching environment later clears the token + workspace and requires a fresh
`login`.

Next Claude runs the `login` tool — your browser opens for OAuth2 sign-in against the chosen
environment's account URL and the token is saved. Claude then lists your workspaces with
`getWorkspaces` and lets you pick one **by name**; `set-workspace` (by `name` or `accId`)
saves the choice as `WORKSPACE_ID`. You never need to know the workspace id.

The token is saved to `.env` in your working directory (mode `0600`) and reused on every subsequent session. When it expires, the login flow triggers again automatically.

You can also trigger login manually at any time:

```
log in to Simulator
```

### Static token (optional)

If you prefer to manage the token yourself, set it in `.env` or export it before starting Claude Code, Codex or Kiro:

```bash
export ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

The static token takes priority over saved credentials.

## Configuration

| Environment variable          | Required | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ACCESS_TOKEN`                | No       | Static token — overrides OAuth2 saved credentials                           |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT`     | No       | Token expiry timestamp (RFC 3339) — written automatically after OAuth login |
| `ACCOUNT_URL`                 | No       | OAuth account (SA) URL — set automatically by `set-environment` (derived from the gateway's public config); overrides the default `https://account.corezoid.com` |
| `WORKSPACE_ID`                | No       | Default workspace ID (`accId`) — set automatically after `set-workspace`    |
| `SIMULATOR_PROFILE`           | No       | Environment profile: `local` \| `prod` (default `prod`); also via `--profile` |
| `SIMULATOR_API_BASE_URL`      | No       | API base URL — set automatically by `set-environment`; overrides the profile (e.g. `http://localhost:9000/papi/1.0`) |
| `SIMULATOR_ACCOUNT_URL`       | No       | Override the profile's OAuth account (SA) URL                                |
| `SIMULATOR_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`   | No       | OAuth2 client ID — on-prem deployments with a custom authorization server should set this to their own client ID; cloud (account.corezoid.com) users do not need it |

All values are read from a `.env` file in the current working directory at startup, and the `login` / `set-workspace` tools persist their results back to that file.

## Usage

Once installed, just talk to Claude naturally:

```
Create a business process graph for customer onboarding with three steps:
Document Collection → Review → Approval. Add all steps to a layer.
```

```
Create a Car form template with fields: make, model, year, color, VIN.
Add financial accounts: purchase value (USD asset), maintenance costs (USD expense),
and a mileage counter (km).
```

```
Record a $450 maintenance transaction on the Toyota Camry actor.
Then show me all accounts and their current balances.
```

```
Search for all actors of form type "Task" on the "Main Process" layer.
```

```
Pull layer 1a2b3c4d-... to a local YAML, let me edit it, then push it back.
```

## MCP Tools

The MCP server exposes a **curated, typed tool set (~95 tools)** scoped to the core
scenarios — forms, actors, accounts, transactions, graph building, applications/smart forms
— rather than the entire REST surface. Each tool maps to a backend operation by its
`operationId`; a drift gate keeps the set in sync with the live `/papi/1.0` contract.

Read tools take an optional **`filter`** parameter — a comma-separated allow-list of fields
to return (e.g. `id,title,data.status`; dotted paths pick nested `data` fields). The backend
prunes the response to just those fields, so prefer it whenever only part of an entity is
needed to keep responses (and token cost) small. Available on every read/lookup/list tool:
`getActor`, `getActorByRef`, `searchActors`, `searchLayerActors`, `filterActors`, `getForm`,
`getForms`, `searchForms`, `getAccount`, `getAccounts`, `getBalance`, `getCurrencies`, `getAccountNames`,
`getTransactions`, `getTransfer`, `getRelatedActors`, `getLinkedActors`, `getActorLinks`,
`getLayerActors`, `getEdgeTypes`, `searchAll`, `getWorkspaces`. (For `getLayerActors`/`searchAll` it projects
the actor/node items.)

**Curated API operations** (one tool per backend operation):

The server exposes a curated, typed tool set declared in Go (not a generic spec passthrough);
a drift gate validates those declarations against the backend's `papi-openapi.json`. Skills
add the domain knowledge on top. For the full design — profiles, the tool registry, engines,
the drift gate, and the auth flow — see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Skills reference

### `/simulator`
Universal Simulator assistant. Knows the full platform model, all entity types, and common workflow sequences. Use this when you need guidance across multiple domains or want to explore what's possible.

### `/simulator-init`
Environment setup assistant — runs `login`, picks a workspace, and saves credentials to `.env`. Use it the first time you connect to Simulator or when switching workspaces.

### `/simulator-graph`
Specialist for graph structure operations:
- Create, update, search, and delete actors
- Create single or bulk links between actors
- Manage layers — add actors with positions, search by form or text, move between layers
- Traverse the graph — get linked actors, actor links, global layer membership
- Pull a whole layer to YAML, edit locally, push it back

### `/simulator-actors`
Specialist for actor instances (the *records* of a form / Account Template):
- Create and update actors with a `data` object keyed by the form's field `id`s (`item_<digits>`)
- Get the per-class `data` value shapes right (string / number / boolean / option arrays / `{type,title,value}` references / calendar objects)
- Read by UUID or `(formId, ref)`, set status, delete
- Search across the workspace (`searchActors`) and list/rank a form's actors, optionally by account balance (`filterActors`)

### `/simulator-smart-forms`
Specialist for Smart Form (CDU / Script / Application) authoring:
- Pull all env files to disk with `pullSmartForm`, push changes with `pushSmartForm`

## Local development

Run the plugin from this repo (developing it, or testing against a local `pong-server`),
not from the marketplace.

**Requirements:** Go 1.24+, and a backend — a local `pong-server` on `http://localhost:9000`
(profile `local`) or the public gateway (profile `prod`).

### 1. Pick the environment

Create `plugins/simulator/mcp-server/.env`:

```
SIMULATOR_PROFILE=local      # or prod
```

Running with the **`local` profile** (via `SIMULATOR_PROFILE=local` or `--profile local`) does
two things for development:

- the server starts pointed at a local `pong-server` on `http://localhost:9000`;
- **`set-environment` additionally offers a `local` preset** (`localhost:9000`) — i.e.
  `set-environment(preset="local")` works. In the default `prod` profile that preset is
  hidden, so end users are only offered the cloud gateways (`mw` / `sim`) and a custom URL.

`login` / `set-workspace` (and `set-environment`) write `ACCESS_TOKEN` / `WORKSPACE_ID` /
`SIMULATOR_API_BASE_URL` / `ACCOUNT_URL` back into this same file.

### 2. Connect it in Claude Code

Pick **one** way (don't combine — two would register the `simulator` server twice):

- **Plugin dir (recommended for dev):** start Claude Code pointing at the repo —
  ```bash
  claude --plugin-dir /Users/<you>/PJ/control/simulator-ai-plugin/plugins/simulator
  ```
  To run against the **local** backend, prefix the launch with `SIMULATOR_PROFILE` — the
  MCP server inherits it from the Claude Code process, so you don't have to edit `.env`:
  ```bash
  SIMULATOR_PROFILE=local claude --plugin-dir /Users/<you>/PJ/control/simulator-ai-plugin/plugins/simulator
  ```
  (This targets `pong-server` on `:9000` and makes `set-environment` offer the `local`
  preset; without it the server defaults to the `prod` profile. An env var set this way
  wins over `mcp-server/.env`. Equivalently: put `SIMULATOR_PROFILE=local` in
  `plugins/simulator/mcp-server/.env`.)
- **Local marketplace install:**
  ```
  /plugin marketplace add /Users/<you>/PJ/control/simulator-ai-plugin/plugins/simulator
  /plugin install simulator@simulator
  /reload-plugins
  ```
- **Project auto-load:** simply opening this repo as your project loads the root
  `.mcp.json` (a project-scoped server) — approve it when Claude Code asks.

Verify with `/mcp` — you should see **simulator** ✓ with ~50 tools.

> **Avoiding conflicts with the installed (prod) plugin.** If you also have the published
> `simulator@simulator` plugin installed, it registers the **same** `simulator` MCP server
> and the same skills — so two copies collide. While developing locally, **disable the prod
> plugin**:
> ```
> /plugin                       # toggle simulator@simulator OFF (or: claude plugin disable simulator@simulator)
> ```
> Re-enable it when you're done. Disabling is the only clean option if you're testing the
> **skills** (they reference tools by bare name, so with both active they'd drive whichever
> server wins — usually prod, against the prod backend).
>
> If you must run both at once (e.g. to call your dev tools explicitly via
> `mcp__simulator-dev__*` while keeping prod for normal use), rename the server in the root
> `.mcp.json` from `simulator` to `simulator-dev` so the MCP server names don't clash. The
> prod backend vs your local backend stay separate anyway — each instance reads its own
> `.env` (the installed plugin's dir vs `plugins/simulator/mcp-server/.env`).

### 3. Authenticate and choose a workspace

```
log in to Simulator          # OAuth in the browser → token saved to .env
which workspaces do I have?  # getWorkspaces → list by name
work in <workspace name>     # set-workspace(name=…) → saves WORKSPACE_ID
```

### 4. Restart after you change the plugin

Edited Go code, a tool, `.env`, `.mcp.json`, or a skill? Reload — **no reinstall needed**:

```
/reload-plugins
```

This kills and relaunches the Go MCP server (`go run ./cmd/server`), re-reading the source
and `.env`. Check `/mcp` again if a server shows as failed (see its **Errors** tab in
`/plugin`).

### Run / test outside Claude Code

```bash
make run-local      # go run ./cmd/server --profile local
make run-prod       # against the public gateway
make inspect        # MCP Inspector web UI wrapping the server (PROFILE=local|prod)
make test           # unit + scenario + drift + eval tests
make lint           # golangci-lint v2 (gosec clean; style backlog)
make eval           # behavioural eval, dry (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
make eval-live      # behavioural eval executing tools against the backend
```

`make inspect` launches the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)
(needs Node.js / `npx`) — a browser UI to list and call the server's tools and read its
resources by hand. It prints a `localhost:6274` URL with a session token; open it, hit
**Connect**, then browse **Tools** / **Resources**. Authenticate first (the `login` tool or
a valid `.env`) since calls hit the real backend. See the
[MCP server README](plugins/simulator/mcp-server/README.md#inspecting--debugging-with-the-mcp-inspector)
for the headless `--cli` mode.

## Debugging

Run the server directly against a profile (it logs startup config and request errors to
stderr):

```bash
cd plugins/simulator/mcp-server
go run ./cmd/server --profile local
```

Tests cover config, the HTTP client, the curated tools (scenarios + `-race`), the backend
drift gate, and the eval scenarios:

```bash
go test ./...
```
